###What I Learned?


Through building this project, I gained valuable experience working with APIs. I primarily used the GET method and worked with query strings. I also learned how to read API documentation effectively.
Additionally, I learned how to use `change` and `input` event listeners to get values from the color picker and dropdown menus.
